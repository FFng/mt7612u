    Module Name:
    ap_apcli.c

    Abstract:
    Support AP-Client function.

    Note:
    1. Call RT28xx_ApCli_Init() in init function and
       call RT28xx_ApCli_Remove() in close function

    2. MAC of ApCli-interface is initialized in RT28xx_ApCli_Init()

    3. ApCli index (0) of different rx packet is got in
       APHandleRxDoneInterrupt() by using FromWhichBSSID = pEntry->apidx;
       Or FromWhichBSSID = BSS0;

    4. ApCli index (0) of different tx packet is assigned in
       rt28xx_send_packets() by using RTMP_SET_PACKET_NET_DEVICE_APCLI()
    5. ApCli index (0) of different interface is got in APHardTransmit() by using
       RTMP_GET_PACKET_IF()

    6. ApCli index (0) of IOCTL command is put in pAd->OS_Cookie->ioctl_if

    8. The number of ApCli only can be 1

	9. apcli convert engine subroutines, we should just take care data packet.
